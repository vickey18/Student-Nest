### Changes made:
1. **Gray Text Styling:** 
   - I used `<span style="color:grey;">` to make certain headings and links appear in gray for a subtle and professional look.
   - This styling is applied to parts like section titles under **Features**, **Installation**, **Contact**, and **Links**.
   
2. **Improved Readability:**
   - Used `<span style="color:grey;">` to make the important sections (like URLs and contact details) appear in gray, keeping them visible but not too prominent.

This approach gives your README a clean, professional, and visually appealing appearance with focused emphasis where needed.
